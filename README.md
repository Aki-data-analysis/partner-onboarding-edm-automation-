# Partner Onboarding EDM Automation Flow (Demo Project)

This project simulates an onboarding automation flow for external partners (e.g., introducing brokers) using CRM-based triggers and automated email campaigns (EDM).

**This EDM flow is designed for newly onboarded IB partners**, guiding them through each critical step of the onboarding process and helping maximize engagement early on.

---

## 📈 Overview

- Simulated the full onboarding journey from partner account creation to long-term engagement milestones.
- Built an EDM automation tree based on CRM-recorded actions, agreements, and partner behavior.
- Used Mermaid.js to visualize the flow for better documentation and scalability.
- Implemented simple JavaScript pseudo-code logic for conditional email triggers.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Mermaid.js**: Visualizing onboarding workflows and automation trees.
- **Markdown**: Structuring documentation.
- **(Optional) JavaScript (pseudo-code)**: Simulating CRM event-based logic.
